# hands_on_llm

This is a sandbox repository I created as I explore the O'Reilly book Hands-On LLMs by Alammar & Grootendorst.

The intention is to work through and extend examples provided to increase my familiarity with these recent innovations. Hopefully anyone leverging this resource will find it equally helpful.

## Setup

This repository follows the guidelines of the book in terms of development environment and setup. Specifically, the intention is to connect individual notebooks to a Google Colab instance to leverage cloud compute resources for testing and exploration.
